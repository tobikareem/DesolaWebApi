# Hybrid API Approach for Desola Flights: Detailed Implementation Strategy

Let me break down how the hybrid API approach would function for your Desola Flights platform and how these different data sources would connect in the overall implementation.

## Overview of the Hybrid Approach

The hybrid approach combines multiple flight data sources to overcome the limitations of any single API while maximizing coverage, accuracy, and feature capabilities. Here's how they work together:

### 1. Data Collection Layer

**Primary Data Sources** (core flight availability and pricing):
- Amadeus provides comprehensive global flight inventory with detailed pricing and availability
- Kiwi.com offers unique virtual interlining capabilities (combining non-partner airlines)
- Skyscanner delivers competitive fare comparisons across multiple booking channels

**Supplementary Data Sources** (enhanced details and direct connections):
- Direct airline NDC connections provide carrier-specific offerings, ancillaries, and seat availability
- IATA NDC APIs standardize access to participating airlines with rich content

### 2. Data Integration and Normalization

Each API returns data in different formats, with different fields, and at different levels of detail. Your system needs to:

1. **Normalize data structures**: Convert all flight data into a standardized internal format
2. **Reconcile duplicates**: Identify and merge duplicate flight options from different sources
3. **Enrich incomplete data**: Use supplementary sources to fill gaps in primary data

For example, Amadeus might return a flight without detailed baggage allowance, which you can enrich with data from the airline's NDC API.

### 3. Algorithmic Processing Layer

Once normalized, your specialized algorithms process this enriched data to discover:

1. **Hidden-city opportunities**: Identifying flights where booking beyond the desired destination is cheaper
2. **Multi-carrier combinations**: Finding optimal combinations of separate tickets
3. **Price anomalies**: Detecting unusual pricing patterns that can be leveraged

### 4. Real-time Data Orchestration

The system needs to make multiple concurrent API calls while maintaining performance:

1. **Asynchronous processing**: Using async/await patterns to make parallel API requests
2. **Intelligent caching**: Storing frequently-accessed route data to reduce API calls
3. **Fallback mechanisms**: If one API fails or times out, seamlessly using alternatives

### 5. Continuous Integration Cycle

The system constantly improves through:

1. **Success tracking**: Recording which API combinations led to the best deals
2. **Adaptive sourcing**: Dynamically adjusting which APIs to query based on route, time, and past performance
3. **Feedback integration**: Learning from booking outcomes to refine future searches

## Detailed Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure

Start by building connectors to your primary APIs:

1. **API adapters**: Create individual modules for each API (Amadeus, Kiwi, Skyscanner)
2. **Rate limiting management**: Implement queuing systems to respect API rate limits
3. **Error handling**: Develop robust error recovery for API failures
4. **Basic caching**: Implement a caching layer for frequently searched routes

### Phase 2: Data Normalization Engine

Develop a system to standardize data across sources:

1. **Schema mapping**: Create mappings between each API's response format and your internal format
2. **Entity resolution**: Build algorithms to identify identical flights across different sources
3. **Data enrichment pipeline**: Create processes to merge and enhance flight data

### Phase 3: Algorithm Development

Implement your core competitive advantage algorithms:

1. **Hidden-city detection**: Algorithms to identify routes where layover cities are cheaper destinations
2. **Multi-carrier optimization**: Logic to find optimal combinations of separate tickets
3. **Pricing anomaly detection**: Machine learning models to identify unusual pricing patterns

### Phase 4: Real-time Orchestration System

Build the system that orchestrates API calls and processes results:

1. **Query planner**: Determines which APIs to call for each search based on route characteristics
2. **Concurrent request manager**: Handles parallel API requests efficiently
3. **Results aggregator**: Combines and ranks results from multiple sources

### Phase 5: Feedback and Optimization Loop

Implement systems to continuously improve results:

1. **Deal effectiveness tracking**: Record which combinations of API calls and algorithms find the best deals
2. **Adaptive query planning**: Adjust API call strategies based on historical performance
3. **User feedback integration**: Incorporate user booking choices to refine algorithms

## Technical Components That Connect These Layers

1. **API Gateway**: Manages all external API communications, handles authentication, rate limiting
2. **Data Transformation Pipeline**: Converts, normalizes, and enriches flight data
3. **Algorithmic Engine**: Core proprietary algorithms that identify special routing opportunities
4. **Cache Management System**: Intelligent caching to balance freshness with API efficiency
5. **Orchestration Service**: Coordinates the overall search process across multiple data sources

This multi-layered approach allows you to leverage the strengths of each data source while mitigating their individual weaknesses, creating a comprehensive flight search system that can find opportunities conventional systems miss.
